This was a pretty straightforward JS clock build. The tutorial video did have an error for the hour hand calculation but it was an easy spot and I changed it accordingly! It was nice to have a bash at this clock app alone as I remember getting a little confused when we built a similar one in week 2 of the boot camp ðŸ˜„
